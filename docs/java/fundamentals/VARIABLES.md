# Variables

In Java, a variable is a named memory location where you can hold data
that can change (vary) as the program runs. Think of it like a container or box for storing info.

## Memory and Categorization

Essentially, when you create a variable, Java sets aside a specific amount of RAM, and the behavior
of this memory is governed by the category of the variable:

- **Primitive Variables**: Store the actual value of the variable in memory. 

- **Reference Variables**: Store a handle/reference to an object is stored in memory.
Reference variables are not pointers. More on these variables in the Object-Oriented Programming and Data
Structures sections

In this section, we'll focus primarily on the primitive variables.

## Creating a Variable

Java is a statically typed language, meaning that every variable must be declared with a data type
when the code compiles. This is to ensure that you are not trying to store _text_ inside a 
"box" that's meant for a _number_. Primitive variables can only be declared with primitive data types, 
including:

- `byte`
- `short`
- `int`
- `long`
- `boolean`
- `float`
- `double`
- `char`

### Variable Formula

The general formula for creating any primitive variable is:

```java
[data type] [variable name] = [value];
```

### Declaration

The first step of creating a variable is to declare it. To do so, you must tell Java what
data type the variable is storing, and the name of the variable.

```java
int numMotors; // Reserves a memory location for an integer called numMotors
```

### Initialization

Then, once the variable is declared, it can be initialized. To initialize a variable, simply
set it equal to its value.

```java
numMotors = 4; // Sets the numMotors variable to the integer value of 4
```

A shortcut approach to creating a variable is to declare and initialize the variable 
on the same line, like so:

```java
int numMotors = 4; // Declares and initializes the numMotors variable
```

## Strings

Strings are objects that represent a sequence of characters. Strings are an example of a
reference variable, since they are a handle to an object of the `String` class stored in memory. Strings are initialized with a string literal, which is surrounded
with quotes.

Strings, while they are an object, can be declared
and initialized the same way as a primitive variable.

```java
String frcYear = "2026"; // Declaring a String with name frcYear and string literal of 2026
```

For more information about objects, such as Strings, check out the Object-Oriented Programming section.



### Assigning and Comparing Values

#### Assigning Variables with... Variables

When assigning a variable's value to a primitive variable, the value is copied.

```java
int i = 1;
int j = i; // The variable j would be equal to i, which is 1

i += 2;

System.out.print(i + " " + j);
```
Output:

```text
3 1
```

However, for a reference variable, the handle is copied, meaning that the reference type
object isn't copied. Therefore, the object is "shared" between the two reference variables.
```java
String greeting = "hi";
String greeting2 = greeting;

greeting2 += ", hello";

System.out.print(greeting);
System.out.print(greeting2);
```
Output:

```text
hi
hi, hello
```

#### Comparing Variables

When comparing values with the `==` operator, it's important to note that if you are
comparing primitive variables, their values will be compared, while if you are comparing
reference variables, their addresses are compared. 

<details>
<summary>Show code</summary>

```java
int i = 1;
int j = 1;

String greeting = new String("hi");
String greeting2 = new String("hi");

if (i == j)
  System.out.println("i and j are equal");
else
  System.out.println("i and j are not equal);
 
if (greeting == greeting2)
  System.out.println("the greetings are equal");
else
  System.out.println("the greetings are not equal);
```
</details>

Output:
```text
i and j are equal
the greetings are not equal
```

To compare reference variables, you must use the `equals()` method. More on this in the Control Flow and 
Object-Oriented Programming sections.

## Variable Scope

Variables have boundaries based on their scope (where they live). 

- **Local Variables**: Declared inside a method or block of code. They only exist while that block
  of code is running and are destroyed as soon as the block is done executing
- **Instance Variables**: Declared inside a class but outside any methods. They belong
  to specific objects and persist in memory as long as the object exists
- **Static Variables**: Declared with the `static` keyword and belong only to the class itself

For more info, see the Object-Oriented Programming section.

## Rules and Naming Conventions

Java syntax requires strict adherence to rules, and FRC 190 has some standard style conventions

### Rules

- Names are case-sensitive: `numMotors` and `NumMotors` are different variables
- Names cannot start with a digit: `1stMotorCANID` is an illegal name
- Names cannot use reserved Java keywords such as `class`, `public`, or `int`
- Names cannot have spaces
- Floating point literals default to `double`. To differentiate a float from a double, you must add an `f` suffix, and to differentiate
  a long from an integer, add an `L` suffix (java automatically handles this, however)
  - ```float velocityMetersPerSecond = 0.5f; ```java
  - ```long bigNumber = 4500000000L;```

### Conventions

- Names should use camelCase: `numMotors` instead of `NumMotors`
- Names should be descriptive: `numMotors` instead of `nM`
- Names should have units: `velocityMetersPerSecond` instead of `velocity`;
- Constants (see next section) are in all caps: `ROLLER_SLOW_VOLTAGE` instead of `rollerSlowVoltage`
