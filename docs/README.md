# FRC 190 Code Standards
Welcome to the official website for the code standard guidelines of FRC 190. These standards serve as a comprehensive reference for all team members to follow when writing code for our robotics projects. Consistency and readability are crucial aspects of maintaining a high-quality codebase, and these guidelines are designed to promote best practices across all our programming endeavors.

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to establish a set of standards and conventions that ensure clarity, maintainability, and collaboration within our team's software development process. By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to:

* Enhance code readability and comprehension for all team members.
* Facilitate seamless collaboration by maintaining consistent coding styles and practices.
* Promote efficiency and reduce errors through standardized approaches to coding, documentation, and testing.
* Cultivate a culture of excellence and professionalism in our software development efforts.

## How to Use These Standards
In this document, you will find detailed guidelines covering various aspects of coding standards, including naming conventions, formatting rules, documentation practices, and more. When refactoring robot code, it is important to go through class by class and make sure each one is up to each of the standards listed below.

We encourage all team members to actively contribute to the evolution of our code standards by suggesting improvements, reporting issues, or proposing new guidelines through the repository's [issue tracker](https://github.com/Team-190/190-Robot-Code-Standards/issues) and [pull request mechanism](https://github.com/Team-190/190-Robot-Code-Standards/pulls). Together, we can continuously refine our practices and elevate the quality of our codebase.
